- 👋 Hi, I’m @david-garza

- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics, data, visualizations, and applications. I also enjoy playing and learning about modifications in computer simulators such as X Plane and Kerbal Space program. I have always had an interest in space science and I hold a private pilot certificate.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analytics using python via an online bootcamp. I am also self learning C++ just because I want to learn more about computer science.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analtyics projects and simulations.
